# crud-level-1

## This CRUD is about a toDoList with many options like: title, description, level of priority (important!, not so important... and not important);
## In this first CRUD approach I would like to use the lesser kind of technology as possible. It is interesting (for me and I hope for you too) how can we code an app or 
web app using only a few tools.
